But this can sometimes lead to unexpected behaviors if we don\u2019t understand all the implications of type embedding. Throughout this section, we look at how to embed types, what these bring, and the possible issues.</p> <p>In Go, a struct field is called embedded if it\u2019s declared without a name. For example,</p> <pre><code>type Foo struct {\n    Bar // Embedded field\n}\n\ntype Bar struct {\n    Baz int\n}\n</code></pre> <p>In the <code>Foo</code> struct, the <code>Bar</code> type is declared without an associated name; hence, it\u2019s an embedded field.</p> <p>We use embedding to promote the fields and methods of an embedded type. Because <code>Bar</code> contains a <code>Baz</code> field, this field is promoted to <code>Foo</code>. Therefore, <code>Baz</code> becomes available from <code>Foo</code>.</p> <p>What can we say about type embedding? First, let\u2019s note that it\u2019s rarely a necessity, and it means that whatever the use case, we can probably solve it as well without type embedding. Type embedding is mainly used for convenience: in most cases, to promote behaviors.</p> <p>If we decide to use type embedding, we need to keep two main constraints in mind:</p> <ul> <li>It shouldn\u2019t be used solely as some syntactic sugar to simplify accessing a field (such as <code>Foo.Baz()</code> instead of <code>Foo.Bar.Baz()</code>). If this is the only rationale, let\u2019s not embed the inner type and use a field instead.</li> <li>It shouldn\u2019t promote data (fields) or a behavior (methods) we want to hide from the outside: for example, if it allows clients to access a locking behavior that should remain private to the struct.</li> </ul> <p>Using type embedding consciously by keeping these constraints in mind can help avoid boilerplate code with additional forwarding methods. However, let\u2019s make sure we don\u2019t do it solely for cosmetics and not promote elements that should remain hidden.</p> <p> Source code</p>"},{"location":"#not-using-the-functional-options-pattern-11","title":"Not using the functional options pattern (#11)","text":"TL;DR <p>To handle options conveniently and in an API-friendly manner, use the functional options pattern.</p> <p>Although there are different implementations with minor variations, the main idea is as follows:</p> <ul> <li>An unexported struct holds the configuration: options.</li> <li>Each option is a function that returns the same type: <code>type Option func(options *options) error</code>.

For example, should we organize our application by context or by layer? It depends on our preferences. We may favor grouping code per context (such as the customer context, the contract context, etc.), or we may favor following hexagonal architecture principles and group per technical layer. If the decision we make fits our use case, it cannot be a wrong decision, as long as we remain consistent with it.</p> <p>Regarding packages, there are multiple best practices that we should follow. First, we should avoid premature packaging because it might cause us to overcomplicate a project. Sometimes, it\u2019s better to use a simple organization and have our project evolve when we understand what it contains rather than forcing ourselves to make the perfect structure up front. Granularity is another essential thing to consider. We should avoid having dozens of nano packages containing only one or two files. If we do, it\u2019s because we have probably missed some logical connections across these packages, making our project harder for readers to understand. Conversely, we should also avoid huge packages that dilute the meaning of a package name.</p> <p>Package naming should also be considered with care. As we all know (as developers), naming is hard. To help clients understand a Go project, we should name our packages after what they provide, not what they contain. Also, naming should be meaningful. Therefore, a package name should be short, concise, expressive, and, by convention, a single lowercase word.</p> <p>Regarding what to export, the rule is pretty straightforward. We should minimize what should be exported as much as possible to reduce the coupling between packages and keep unnecessary exported elements hidden. If we are unsure whether to export an element or not, we should default to not exporting it. Later, if we discover that we need to export it, we can adjust our code. Let\u2019s also keep in mind some exceptions, such as making fields exported so that a struct can be unmarshaled with encoding/json.</p> <p>Organizing a project isn\u2019t straightforward, but following these rules should help make it easier to maintain. However, remember that consistency is also vital to ease maintainability. Therefore, let\u2019s make sure that we keep things as consistent as possible within a codebase.</p> Note <p>In 2023, the Go team has published an official guideline for organizing / structuring a Go project: go.dev/doc/modules/layout</p>"},{"location":"#creating-utility-packages-13","title":"Creating utility packages (#13)","text":"TL;DR <p>Naming is a critical piece of application design.

Perhaps we want to perform an operation for each rune in the string or implement a custom function to search for a specific substring. In both cases, we have to iterate on the different runes of a string. But it\u2019s easy to get confused about how iteration works.</p> <p>For example, consider the following example:</p> <pre><code>s := \"h\u00eallo\"\nfor i := range s {\n    fmt.Printf(\"position %d: %c\\n\", i, s[i])\n}\nfmt.Printf(\"len=%d\\n\", len(s))\n</code></pre> <pre><code>position 0: h\nposition 1: \u00c3\nposition 3: l\nposition 4: l\nposition 5: o\nlen=6\n</code></pre> <p>Let's highlight three points that might be confusing:</p> <ul> <li>The second rune is \u00c3 in the output instead of \u00ea.</li> <li>We jumped from position 1 to position 3: what is at position 2?</li> <li>len returns a count of 6, whereas s contains only 5 runes.</li> </ul> <p>Let\u2019s start with the last observation. We already mentioned that len returns the number of bytes in a string, not the number of runes. Because we assigned a string literal to <code>s</code>, <code>s</code> is a UTF-8 string. Meanwhile, the special character \"\u00ea\" isn\u2019t encoded in a single byte; it requires 2 bytes. Therefore, calling <code>len(s)</code> returns 6.</p> <p>Meanwhile, in the previous example, we have to understand that we don't iterate over each rune; instead, we iterate over each starting index of a rune:</p> <p></p> <p>Printing <code>s[i]</code> doesn\u2019t print the ith rune; it prints the UTF-8 representation of the byte at index <code>i</code>.

Indeed, converting a string into a slice of runes requires allocating an additional slice and converting the bytes into runes: an O(n) time complexity with n the number of bytes in the string.

In general, parallel goroutines require synchronization and hence mutexes. Conversely, concurrent goroutines generally require coordination and orchestration and hence channels.</p> <p>Given a concurrency problem, it may not always be clear whether we can implement a solution using channels or mutexes. Because Go promotes sharing memory by communication, one mistake could be to always force the use of channels, regardless of the use case. However, we should see the two options as complementary. </p> <p>When should we use channels or mutexes? We will use the example in the next figure as a backbone. Our example has three different goroutines with specific relationships:</p> <ul> <li>G1 and G2 are parallel goroutines. They may be two goroutines executing the same function that keeps receiving messages from a channel, or perhaps two goroutines executing the same HTTP handler at the same time.</li> <li>On the other hand, G1 and G3 are concurrent goroutines, as are G2 and G3. All the goroutines are part of an overall concurrent structure, but G1 and G2 perform the first step, whereas G3 does the next step.</li> </ul> <p>In general, parallel goroutines have to synchronize: for example, when they need to access or mutate a shared resource such as a slice. Synchronization is enforced with mutexes but not with any channel types (not with buffered channels). Hence, in general, synchronization between parallel goroutines should be achieved via mutexes.</p> <p>Conversely, in general, concurrent goroutines have to coordinate and orchestrate. For example, if G3 needs to aggregate results from both G1 and G2, G1 and G2 need to signal to G3 that a new intermediate result is available. This coordination falls under the scope of communication\u2014therefore, channels.</p> <p>Regarding concurrent goroutines, there\u2019s also the case where we want to transfer the ownership of a resource from one step (G1 and G2) to another (G3); for example, if G1 and G2 are enriching a shared resource and at some point, we consider this job as complete. Here, we should use channels to signal that a specific resource is ready and handle the ownership transfer.</p> <p>Mutexes and channels have different semantics. Whenever we want to share a state or access a shared resource, mutexes ensure exclusive access to this resource. Conversely, channels are a mechanic for signaling with or without data (<code>chan struct{}</code> or not). Coordination or ownership transfer should be achieved via channels.

When the context is canceled, the watcher struct should close its resources. However, can we guarantee that watch will have time to do so? Absolutely not\u2014and that\u2019s a design flaw.</p> <p>The problem is that we used signaling to convey that a goroutine had to be stopped. We didn\u2019t block the parent goroutine until the resources had been closed.

Starting a goroutine without knowing when to stop it is a design issue. Whenever a goroutine is started, we should have a clear plan about when it will stop. Last but not least, if a goroutine creates resources and its lifetime is bound to the lifetime of the application, it\u2019s probably safer to wait for this goroutine to complete before exiting the application.

Assimilating these two concepts is essential for efficiently handling core operations such as slice initialization and adding elements with append, copying, or slicing. This misunderstanding can lead to using slices suboptimally or even to memory leaks.</p> <p>In Go, a slice is backed by an array. That means the slice\u2019s data is stored contiguously in an array data structure. A slice also handles the logic of adding an element if the backing array is full or shrinking the backing array if it\u2019s almost empty.</p> <p>Internally, a slice holds a pointer to the backing array plus a length and a capacity. The length is the number of elements the slice contains, whereas the capacity is the number of elements in the backing array, counting from the first element in the slice. Let\u2019s go through a few examples to make things clearer. First, let\u2019s initialize a slice with a given length and capacity:</p> <pre><code>s := make([]int, 3, 6) // Three-length, six-capacity slice\n</code></pre> <p>The first argument, representing the length, is mandatory. However, the second argument representing the capacity is optional. Figure 1 shows the result of this code in memory.</p> <p> </p> Figure 1: A three-length, six-capacity slice. <p>In this case, <code>make</code> creates an array of six elements (the capacity). But because the length was set to 3, Go initializes only the first three elements. Also, because the slice is an <code>[]int</code> type, the first three elements are initialized to the zeroed value of an <code>int</code>: 0. The grayed elements are allocated but not yet used.</p> <p>If we print this slice, we get the elements within the range of the length, <code>[0 0 0]</code>. If we set <code>s[1]</code> to 1, the second element of the slice updates without impacting its length or capacity. Figure 2 illustrates this.</p> <p> </p> Figure 2: Updating the slice\u2019s second element: s[1] = 1. <p>However, accessing an element outside the length range is forbidden, even though it\u2019s already allocated in memory. For example, <code>s[4]</code> = 0 would lead to the following panic:</p> <pre><code>panic: runtime error: index out of range [4] with length 3\n</code></pre> <p>How can we use the remaining space of the slice? By using the <code>append</code> built-in function:</p> <pre><code>s = append(s, 2)\n</code></pre> <p>This code appends to the existing <code>s</code> slice a new element. It uses the first grayed element (which was allocated but not yet used) to store element 2, as figure 3 shows.</p> <p> </p> Figure 3: Appending an element to s. <p>The length of the slice is updated from 3 to 4 because the slice now contains four elements. Now, what happens if we add three more elements so that the backing array isn\u2019t large enough?</p> <pre><code>s = append(s, 3, 4, 5)\nfmt.Println(s)\n</code></pre> <p>If we run this code, we see that the slice was able to cope with our request:</p> <pre><code>[0 1 0 2 3 4 5]\n</code></pre> <p>Because an array is a fixed-size structure, it can store the new elements until element 4. When we want to insert element 5, the array is already full: Go internally creates another array by doubling the capacity, copying all the elements, and then inserting element 5. Figure 4 shows this process.</p> <p> </p> Figure 4: Because the initial backing array is full, Go creates another array and copies all the elements. <p>The slice now references the new backing array. What will happen to the previous backing array? If it\u2019s no longer referenced, it\u2019s eventually freed by the garbage collector (GC) if allocated on the heap. (We discuss heap memory in mistake #95, \u201cNot understanding stack vs. heap,\u201d and we look at how the GC works in mistake #99, \u201cNot understanding how the GC works.\u201d)</p> <p>What happens with slicing? Slicing is an operation done on an array or a slice, providing a half-open range; the first index is included, whereas the second is excluded. The following example shows the impact, and figure 5 displays the result in memory:</p> <pre><code>s1 := make([]int, 3, 6) // Three-length, six-capacity slice\ns2 := s1[1:3] // Slicing from indices 1 to 3\n</code></pre> <p> </p> Figure 5: The slices s1 and s2 reference the same backing array with different lengths and capacities. <p>First, <code>s1</code> is created as a three-length, six-capacity slice. When <code>s2</code> is created by slicing <code>s1</code>, both slices reference the same backing array. However, <code>s2</code> starts from a different index, 1. Therefore, its length and capacity (a two-length, five-capacity slice) differ from s1. If we update <code>s1[1]</code> or <code>s2[0]</code>, the change is made to the same array, hence, visible in both slices, as figure 6 shows.</p> <p> </p> Figure 6: Because s1 and s2 are backed by the same array, updating a common element makes the change visible in both slices. <p>Now, what happens if we append an element to <code>s2</code>? Does the following code change <code>s1</code> as well?</p> <pre><code>s2 = append(s2, 2)\n</code></pre> <p>The shared backing array is modified, but only the length of <code>s2</code> changes. Figure 7 shows the result of appending an element to <code>s2</code>.</p> <p> </p> Figure 7: Appending an element to s2. <p><code>s1</code> remains a three-length, six-capacity slice. Therefore, if we print <code>s1</code> and <code>s2</code>, the added element is only visible for <code>s2</code>:</p> <pre><code>s1=[0 1 0], s2=[1 0 2]\n</code></pre> <p>It\u2019s important to understand this behavior so that we don\u2019t make wrong assumptions while using append.</p> Note <p>In these examples, the backing array is internal and not available directly to the Go developer. The only exception is when a slice is created from slicing an existing array.</p> <p>One last thing to note: what if we keep appending elements to <code>s2</code> until the backing array is full? What will the state be, memory-wise? Let\u2019s add three more elements so that the backing array will not have enough capacity:</p> <pre><code>s2 = append(s2, 3)\ns2 = append(s2, 4) // At this stage, the backing is already full\ns2 = append(s2, 5)\n</code></pre> <p>This code leads to creating another backing array. Figure 8 displays the results in memory.</p> <p> </p> Figure 8: Appending elements to s2 until the backing array is full. <p><code>s1</code> and <code>s2</code> now reference two different arrays. As <code>s1</code> is still a three-length, six-capacity slice, it still has some available buffer, so it keeps referencing the initial array. Also, the new backing array was made by copying the initial one from the first index of <code>s2</code>. That\u2019s why the new array starts with element 1, not 0.</p> <p>To summarize, the slice length is the number of available elements in the slice, whereas the slice capacity is the number of elements in the backing array. Adding an element to a full slice (length == capacity) leads to creating a new backing array with a new capacity, copying all the elements from the previous array, and updating the slice pointer to the new array.</p>"},{"location":"28-maps-memory-leaks/","title":"Maps and memory leaks","text":"<p>When working with maps in Go, we need to understand some important characteristics of how a map grows and shrinks. Let\u2019s delve into this to prevent issues that can cause memory leaks.</p> <p>First, to view a concrete example of this problem, let\u2019s design a scenario where we will work with the following map:</p> <pre><code>m := make(map[int][128]byte)\n</code></pre> <p>Each value of m is an array of 128 bytes. We will do the following:</p> <ol> <li>Allocate an empty map.</li> <li>Add 1 million elements.</li> <li>Remove all the elements, and run a Garbage Collection (GC).</li> </ol> <p>After each step, we want to print the size of the heap (using a <code>printAlloc</code> utility function). This shows us how this example behaves memory-wise:</p> <pre><code>func main() {\n    n := 1_000_000\n    m := make(map[int][128]byte)\n    printAlloc()\n\n    for i := 0; i &lt; n; i++ { // Adds 1 million elements\n        m[i] = [128]byte{}\n    }\n    printAlloc()\n\n    for i := 0; i &lt; n; i++ { // Deletes 1 million elements\n        delete(m, i)\n    }\n\n    runtime.GC() // Triggers a manual GC\n    printAlloc()\n    runtime.KeepAlive(m) // Keeps a reference to m so that the map isn\u2019t collected\n}\n\nfunc printAlloc() {\n    var m runtime.MemStats\n    runtime.ReadMemStats(&amp;m)\n    fmt.Printf(\"%d MB\\n\", m.Alloc/(1024*1024))\n}\n</code></pre> <p>We allocate an empty map, add 1 million elements, remove 1 million elements, and then run a GC. We also make sure to keep a reference to the map using <code>runtime.KeepAlive</code> so that the map isn\u2019t collected as well. Let\u2019s run this example:</p> <pre><code>0 MB   &lt;-- After m is allocated\n461 MB &lt;-- After we add 1 million elements\n293 MB &lt;-- After we remove 1 million elements\n</code></pre> <p>What can we observe? At first, the heap size is minimal. Then it grows significantly after having added 1 million elements to the map. But if we expected the heap size to decrease after removing all the elements, this isn\u2019t how maps work in Go. In the end, even though the GC has collected all the elements, the heap size is still 293 MB. So the memory shrunk, but not as we might have expected. What\u2019s the rationale? We need to delve into how a map works in Go.</p> <p>A map provides an unordered collection of key-value pairs in which all the keys are distinct. In Go, a map is based on the hash table data structure: an array where each element is a pointer to a bucket of key-value pairs, as shown in figure 1.</p> <p> </p> Figure 1: A hash table example with a focus on bucket 0. <p>Each bucket is a fixed-size array of eight elements. In the case of an insertion into a bucket that is already full (a bucket overflow), Go creates another bucket of eight elements and links the previous one to it. Figure 2 shows an example:</p> <p> </p> Figure 2: In case of a bucket overflow, Go allocates a new bucket and links the previous bucket to it. <p>Under the hood, a Go map is a pointer to a runtime.hmap struct. This struct contains multiple fields, including a B field, giving the number of buckets in the map:</p> <pre><code>type hmap struct {\n    B uint8 // log_2 of # of buckets\n            // (can hold up to loadFactor * 2^B items)\n    // ...\n}\n</code></pre> <p>After adding 1 million elements, the value of B equals 18, which means 2\u00b9\u2078 = 262,144 buckets. When we remove 1 million elements, what\u2019s the value of B? Still 18. Hence, the map still contains the same number of buckets.</p> <p>The reason is that the number of buckets in a map cannot shrink. Therefore, removing elements from a map doesn\u2019t impact the number of existing buckets; it just zeroes the slots in the buckets. A map can only grow and have more buckets; it never shrinks.</p> <p>In the previous example, we went from 461 MB to 293 MB because the elements were collected, but running the GC didn\u2019t impact the map itself. Even the number of extra buckets (the buckets created because of overflows) remains the same.</p> <p>Let\u2019s take a step back and discuss when the fact that a map cannot shrink can be a problem. Imagine building a cache using a <code>map[int][128]byte</code>. This map holds per customer ID (the <code>int</code>), a sequence of 128 bytes. Now, suppose we want to save the last 1,000 customers. The map size will remain constant, so we shouldn\u2019t worry about the fact that a map cannot shrink.</p> <p>However, let\u2019s say we want to store one hour of data. Meanwhile, our company has decided to have a big promotion for Black Friday: in one hour, we may have millions of customers connected to our system. But a few days after Black Friday, our map will contain the same number of buckets as during the peak time. This explains why we can experience high memory consumption that doesn\u2019t significantly decrease in such a scenario.</p> <p>What are the solutions if we don\u2019t want to manually restart our service to clean the amount of memory consumed by the map? One solution could be to re-create a copy of the current map at a regular pace. For example, every hour, we can build a new map, copy all the elements, and release the previous one. The main drawback of this option is that following the copy and until the next garbage collection, we may consume twice the current memory for a short period.</p> <p>Another solution would be to change the map type to store an array pointer: <code>map[int]*[128]byte</code>. It doesn\u2019t solve the fact that we will have a significant number of buckets; however, each bucket entry will reserve the size of a pointer for the value instead of 128 bytes (8 bytes on 64-bit systems and 4 bytes on 32-bit systems).</p> <p>Coming back to the original scenario, let\u2019s compare the memory consumption for each map type following each step. The following table shows the comparison.</p> Step <code>map[int][128]byte</code> <code>map[int]*[128]byte</code> Allocate an empty map 0 MB 0 MB Add 1 million elements 461 MB 182 MB Remove all the elements and run a GC 293 MB 38 MB Note <p>If a key or a value is over 128 bytes, Go won\u2019t store it directly in the map bucket. Instead, Go stores a pointer to reference the key or the value.</p> <p>As we have seen, adding n elements to a map and then deleting all the elements means keeping the same number of buckets in memory. So, we must remember that because a Go map can only grow in size, so does its memory consumption. There is no automated strategy to shrink it. If this leads to high memory consumption, we can try different options such as forcing Go to re-create the map or using pointers to check if it can be optimized.</p>"},{"location":"5-interface-pollution/","title":"Interface pollution","text":"<p>Interfaces are one of the cornerstones of the Go language when designing and structuring our code.

Then, we will see when it\u2019s appropriate to use interfaces and when it may be considered pollution.</p>"},{"location":"5-interface-pollution/#concepts","title":"Concepts","text":"<p>An interface provides a way to specify the behavior of an object. We use interfaces to create common abstractions that multiple objects can implement. What makes Go interfaces so different is that they are satisfied implicitly. There is no explicit keyword like <code>implements</code> to mark that an object X implements interface Y.</p> <p>To understand what makes interfaces so powerful, we will dig into two popular ones from the standard library: <code>io.Reader</code> and <code>io.Writer</code>. The <code>io</code> package provides abstractions for I/O primitives. Among these abstractions, <code>io.Reader</code> relates to reading data from a data source and <code>io.Writer</code> to writing data to a target, as represented in the next figure:</p> <p></p> <p>The <code>io.Reader</code> contains a single Read method:</p> <pre><code>type Reader interface {\n    Read(p []byte) (n int, err error)\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Custom implementations of the <code>io.Reader</code> interface should accept a slice of bytes, filling it with its data and returning either the number of bytes read or an error.</p> <p>On the other hand, <code>io.Writer</code> defines a single method, Write:</p> <pre><code>type Writer interface {\n    Write(p []byte) (n int, err error)\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Custom implementations of <code>io.Writer</code> should write the data coming from a slice to a target and return either the number of bytes written or an error. Therefore, both interfaces provide fundamental abstractions:</p> <ul> <li><code>io.Reader</code> reads data from a source</li> <li><code>io.Writer</code> writes data to a target</li> </ul> <p>What is the rationale for having these two interfaces in the language? What is the point of creating these abstractions?</p> <p>Let\u2019s assume we need to implement a function that should copy the content of one file to another. We could create a specific function that would take as input two <code>*os.Files</code>. Or, we can choose to create a more generic function using <code>io.Reader</code> and <code>io.Writer</code> abstractions:</p> <pre><code>func copySourceToDest(source io.Reader, dest io.Writer) error {\n    // ...\n}\n</code></pre> <p>This function would work with <code>*os.File</code> parameters (as <code>*os.File</code> implements both <code>io.Reader</code> and <code>io.Writer</code>) and any other type that would implement these interfaces. For example, we could create our own <code>io.Writer</code> that writes to a database, and the code would remain the same. It increases the genericity of the function; hence, its reusability.</p> <p>Furthermore, writing a unit test for this function is easier because, instead of having to handle files, we can use the <code>strings</code> and <code>bytes</code> packages that provide helpful implementations:</p> <pre><code>func TestCopySourceToDest(t *testing.T) {\n    const input = \"foo\"\n    source := strings.NewReader(input) // Creates an io.Reader\n    dest := bytes.NewBuffer(make([]byte, 0)) // Creates an io.Writer\n\n    err := copySourceToDest(source, dest) // Calls copySourceToDest from a *strings.Reader and a *bytes.Buffer\n    if err != nil {\n        t.FailNow()\n    }\n\n    got := dest.String()\n    if got != input {\n        t.Errorf(\"expected: %s, got: %s\", input, got)\n    }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>In the example, source is a <code>*strings.Reader</code>, whereas dest is a <code>*bytes.Buffer</code>. Here, we test the behavior of <code>copySourceToDest</code> without creating any files.</p> <p>While designing interfaces, the granularity (how many methods the interface contains) is also something to keep in mind. A known proverb in Go relates to how big an interface should be:</p> <p>Rob Pike</p> <p>The bigger the interface, the weaker the abstraction.</p> <p>Indeed, adding methods to an interface can decrease its level of reusability. <code>io.Reader</code> and <code>io.Writer</code> are powerful abstractions because they cannot get any simpler. Furthermore, we can also combine fine-grained interfaces to create higher-level abstractions. This is the case with <code>io.ReadWriter</code>, which combines the reader and writer behaviors:</p> <pre><code>type ReadWriter interface {\n    Reader\n    Writer\n}\n</code></pre> Note <p>As Einstein said, \u201cEverything should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler.\u201d Applied to interfaces, this denotes that finding the perfect granularity for an interface isn\u2019t necessarily a straightforward process.</p> <p>Let\u2019s now discuss common cases where interfaces are recommended.</p>"},{"location":"5-interface-pollution/#when-to-use-interfaces","title":"When to use interfaces","text":"<p>When should we create interfaces in Go? Let\u2019s look at three concrete use cases where interfaces are usually considered to bring value.

However, these three cases should give us a general idea:</p> <ul> <li>Common behavior </li> <li>Decoupling</li> <li>Restricting behavior</li> </ul>"},{"location":"5-interface-pollution/#common-behavior","title":"Common behavior","text":"<p>The first option we will discuss is to use interfaces when multiple types implement a common behavior. In such a case, we can factor out the behavior inside an interface. If we look at the standard library, we can find many examples of such a use case. For example, sorting a collection can be factored out via three methods:</p> <ul> <li>Retrieving the number of elements in the collection</li> <li>Reporting whether one element must be sorted before another </li> <li>Swapping two elements</li> </ul> <p>Hence, the following interface was added to the <code>sort</code> package:</p> <pre><code>type Interface interface {\n    Len() int // Number of elements\n    Less(i, j int) bool // Checks two elements\n    Swap(i, j int) // Swaps two elements\n}\n</code></pre> <p>This interface has a strong potential for reusability because it encompasses the common behavior to sort any collection that is index-based.</p> <p>Throughout the <code>sort</code> package, we can find dozens of implementations. If at some point we compute a collection of integers, for example, and we want to sort it, are we necessarily interested in the implementation type? Is it important whether the sorting algorithm is a merge sort or a quicksort? In many cases, we don\u2019t care. Hence, the sorting behavior can be abstracted, and we can depend on the <code>sort.Interface</code>.</p> <p>Finding the right abstraction to factor out a behavior can also bring many benefits. For example, the <code>sort</code> package provides utility functions that also rely on <code>sort.Interface</code>, such as checking whether a collection is already sorted. For instance:</p> <pre><code>func IsSorted(data Interface) bool {\n    n := data.Len()\n    for i := n - 1; i &gt; 0; i-- {\n        if data.Less(i, i-1) {\n            return false\n        }\n    }\n    return true\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Because <code>sort.Interface</code> is the right level of abstraction, it makes it highly valuable.</p> <p>Let\u2019s now see another main use case when using interfaces.</p>"},{"location":"5-interface-pollution/#decoupling","title":"Decoupling","text":"<p>Another important use case is about decoupling our code from an implementation. If we rely on an abstraction instead of a concrete implementation, the implementation itself can be replaced with another without even having to change our code. This is the Liskov Substitution Principle (the L in Robert C. Martin\u2019s SOLID design principles).</p> <p>One benefit of decoupling can be related to unit testing. Let\u2019s assume we want to implement a <code>CreateNewCustomer</code> method that creates a new customer and stores it. We decide to rely on the concrete implementation directly (let\u2019s say a <code>mysql.Store</code> struct):</p> <pre><code>type CustomerService struct {\n    store mysql.Store // Depends on the concrete implementation\n}\n\nfunc (cs CustomerService) CreateNewCustomer(id string) error {\n    customer := Customer{id: id}\n    return cs.store.StoreCustomer(customer)\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Now, what if we want to test this method? Because <code>customerService</code> relies on the actual implementation to store a <code>Customer</code>, we are obliged to test it through integration tests, which requires spinning up a MySQL instance (unless we use an alternative technique such as <code>go-sqlmock</code>, but this isn\u2019t the scope of this section). Although integration tests are helpful, that\u2019s not always what we want to do. To give us more flexibility, we should decouple <code>CustomerService</code> from the actual implementation, which can be done via an interface like so:</p> <pre><code>type customerStorer interface { // Creates a storage abstraction\n    StoreCustomer(Customer) error\n}\n\ntype CustomerService struct {\n    storer customerStorer // Decouples CustomerService from the actual implementation\n}\n\nfunc (cs CustomerService) CreateNewCustomer(id string) error {\n    customer := Customer{id: id}\n    return cs.storer.StoreCustomer(customer)\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Because storing a customer is now done via an interface, this gives us more flexibility in how we want to test the method. For instance, we can:</p> <ul> <li>Use the concrete implementation via integration tests </li> <li>Use a mock (or any kind of test double) via unit tests </li> <li>Or both</li> </ul> <p>Let\u2019s now discuss another use case: to restrict a behavior.</p>"},{"location":"5-interface-pollution/#restricting-behavior","title":"Restricting behavior","text":"<p>The last use case we will discuss can be pretty counterintuitive at first sight. It\u2019s about restricting a type to a specific behavior. Let\u2019s imagine we implement a custom configuration package to deal with dynamic configuration.

Here\u2019s how that code would look:</p> <pre><code>type IntConfig struct {\n    // ...\n}\n\nfunc (c *IntConfig) Get() int {\n    // Retrieve configuration\n}\n\nfunc (c *IntConfig) Set(value int) {\n    // Update configuration\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Now, suppose we receive an <code>IntConfig</code> that holds some specific configuration, such as a threshold. Yet, in our code, we are only interested in retrieving the configuration value, and we want to prevent updating it. How can we enforce that, semantically, this configuration is read-only, if we don\u2019t want to change our configuration package? By creating an abstraction that restricts the behavior to retrieving only a config value:</p> <pre><code>type intConfigGetter interface {\n    Get() int\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Then, in our code, we can rely on <code>intConfigGetter</code> instead of the concrete implementation:</p> <pre><code>type Foo struct {\n    threshold intConfigGetter\n}\n\nfunc NewFoo(threshold intConfigGetter) Foo { // Injects the configuration getter\n    return Foo{threshold: threshold}\n}\n\nfunc (f Foo) Bar()  {\n    threshold := f.threshold.Get() // Reads the configuration\n    // ...\n}\n</code></pre> <p>In this example, the configuration getter is injected into the <code>NewFoo</code> factory method. It doesn\u2019t impact a client of this function because it can still pass an <code>IntConfig</code> struct as it implements <code>intConfigGetter</code>. Then, we can only read the configuration in the <code>Bar</code> method, not modify it. Therefore, we can also use interfaces to restrict a type to a specific behavior for various reasons, such as semantics enforcement.</p> <p>In this section, we saw three potential use cases where interfaces are generally considered as bringing value: factoring out a common behavior, creating some decoupling, and restricting a type to a certain behavior.

Each physical core can be composed of multiple logical cores (the concept of hyper-threading), and a logical core is also called a thread. In this post, when we use the word thread, we mean the unit of processing, not a logical core.</p> <p>A CPU core executes different threads. When it switches from one thread to another, it executes an operation called context switching. The active thread consuming CPU cycles was in an executing state and moves to a runnable state, meaning it\u2019s ready to be executed pending an available core. Context switching is considered an expensive operation because the OS needs to save the current execution state of a thread before the switch (such as the current register values).</p> <p>As Go developers, we can\u2019t create threads directly, but we can create goroutines, which can be thought of as application-level threads. However, whereas an OS thread is context-switched on and off a CPU core by the OS, a goroutine is context-switched on and off an OS thread by the Go runtime. Also, compared to an OS thread, a goroutine has a smaller memory footprint: 2 KB for goroutines from Go 1.4. An OS thread depends on the OS, but, for example, on Linux/x86\u201332, the default size is 2 MB (see https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/pthread_create.3.html). Having a smaller size makes context switching faster.</p> Note <p>Context switching a goroutine versus a thread is about 80% to 90% faster, depending on the architecture.</p> <p>Let\u2019s now discuss how the Go scheduler works to overview how goroutines are handled. Internally, the Go scheduler uses the following terminology (see proc.go):</p> <ul> <li>G \u2014 Goroutine</li> <li>M \u2014 OS thread (stands for machine)</li> <li>P \u2014 CPU core (stands for processor)</li> </ul> <p>Each OS thread (M) is assigned to a CPU core (P) by the OS scheduler. Then, each goroutine (G) runs on an M. The GOMAXPROCS variable defines the limit of Ms in charge of executing user-level code simultaneously. But if a thread is blocked in a system call (for example, I/O), the scheduler can spin up more Ms. As of Go 1.5, GOMAXPROCS is by default equal to the number of available CPU cores.</p> <p>A goroutine has a simpler lifecycle than an OS thread. It can be doing one of the following:</p> <ul> <li>Executing \u2014 The goroutine is scheduled on an M and executing its instructions.</li> <li>Runnable \u2014 The goroutine is waiting to be in an executing state.</li> <li>Waiting \u2014 The goroutine is stopped and pending something completing, such as a system call or a synchronization operation (such as acquiring a mutex).</li> </ul> <p>There\u2019s one last stage to understand about the implementation of Go scheduling: when a goroutine is created but cannot be executed yet; for example, all the other Ms are already executing a G. In this scenario, what will the Go runtime do about it? The answer is queuing. The Go runtime handles two kinds of queues: one local queue per P and a global queue shared among all the Ps.</p> <p>Figure 1 shows a given scheduling situation on a four-core machine with GOMAXPROCS equal to 4. The parts are the logical cores (Ps), goroutines (Gs), OS threads (Ms), local queues, and global queue:</p> <p> </p> Figure 1: An example of the current state of a Go application executed on a four-core machine. Goroutines that aren\u2019t in an executing state are either runnable (pending being executed) or waiting (pending a blocking operation) <p>First, we can see five Ms, whereas GOMAXPROCS is set to 4. But as we mentioned, if needed, the Go runtime can create more OS threads than the GOMAXPROCS value.</p> <p>P0, P1, and P3 are currently busy executing Go runtime threads. But P2 is presently idle as M3 is switched off P2, and there\u2019s no goroutine to be executed. This isn\u2019t a good situation because six runnable goroutines are pending being executed, some in the global queue and some in other local queues. How will the Go runtime handle this situation? Here\u2019s the scheduling implementation in pseudocode (see proc.go):</p> <pre><code>runtime.schedule() {\n    // Only 1/61 of the time, check the global runnable queue for a G.\n    // If not found, check the local queue.\n    // If not found,\n    //     Try to steal from other Ps.\n    //     If not, check the global runnable queue.\n    //     If not found, poll network.\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Every sixty-first execution, the Go scheduler will check whether goroutines from the global queue are available. If not, it will check its local queue. Meanwhile, if both the global and local queues are empty, the Go scheduler can pick up goroutines from other local queues. This principle in scheduling is called work stealing, and it allows an underutilized processor to actively look for another processor\u2019s goroutines and steal some.</p> <p>One last important thing to mention: prior to Go 1.14, the scheduler was cooperative, which meant a goroutine could be context-switched off a thread only in specific blocking cases (for example, channel send or receive, I/O, waiting to acquire a mutex). Since Go 1.14, the Go scheduler is now preemptive: when a goroutine is running for a specific amount of time (10 ms), it will be marked preemptible and can be context-switched off to be replaced by another goroutine. This allows a long-running job to be forced to share CPU time.</p> <p>Now that we understand the fundamentals of scheduling in Go, let\u2019s look at a concrete example: implementing a merge sort in a parallel manner.</p>"},{"location":"56-concurrency-faster/#parallel-merge-sort","title":"Parallel Merge Sort","text":"<p>First, let\u2019s briefly review how the merge sort algorithm works. Then we will implement a parallel version. Note that the objective isn\u2019t to implement the most efficient version but to support a concrete example showing why concurrency isn\u2019t always faster.</p> <p>The merge sort algorithm works by breaking a list repeatedly into two sublists until each sublist consists of a single element and then merging these sublists so that the result is a sorted list (see figure 2). Each split operation splits the list into two sublists, whereas the merge operation merges two sublists into a sorted list.</p> <p> </p> Figure 2: Applying the merge sort algorithm repeatedly breaks each list into two sublists. Then the algorithm uses a merge operation such that the resulting list is sorted <p>Here is the sequential implementation of this algorithm. We don\u2019t include all of the code as it\u2019s not the main point of this section:</p> <pre><code>func sequentialMergesort(s []int) {\n    if len(s) &lt;= 1 {\n        return\n    }\n\n    middle := len(s) / 2\n    sequentialMergesort(s[:middle]) // First half\n    sequentialMergesort(s[middle:]) // Second half\n    merge(s, middle) // Merges the two halves\n}\n\nfunc merge(s []int, middle int) {\n    // ...\n}\n</code></pre> <p>This algorithm has a structure that makes it open to concurrency. Indeed, as each sequentialMergesort operation works on an independent set of data that doesn\u2019t need to be fully copied (here, an independent view of the underlying array using slicing), we could distribute this workload among the CPU cores by spinning up each sequentialMergesort operation in a different goroutine. Let\u2019s write a first parallel implementation:</p> <pre><code>func parallelMergesortV1(s []int) {\n    if len(s) &lt;= 1 {\n        return\n    }\n\n    middle := len(s) / 2\n\n    var wg sync.WaitGroup\n    wg.Add(2)\n\n    go func() { // Spins up the first half of the work in a goroutine\n        defer wg.Done()\n        parallelMergesortV1(s[:middle])\n    }()\n\n    go func() { // Spins up the second half of the work in a goroutine\n        defer wg.Done()\n        parallelMergesortV1(s[middle:])\n    }()\n\n    wg.Wait()\n    merge(s, middle) // Merges the halves\n}\n</code></pre> <p>In this version, each half of the workload is handled in a separate goroutine. The parent goroutine waits for both parts by using sync.WaitGroup. Hence, we call the Wait method before the merge operation.</p> <p>We now have a parallel version of the merge sort algorithm. Therefore, if we run a benchmark to compare this version against the sequential one, the parallel version should be faster, correct? Let\u2019s run it on a four-core machine with 10,000 elements:</p> <pre><code>Benchmark_sequentialMergesort-4       2278993555 ns/op\nBenchmark_parallelMergesortV1-4      17525998709 ns/op\n</code></pre> <p>Surprisingly, the parallel version is almost an order of magnitude slower. How can we explain this result? How is it possible that a parallel version that distributes a workload across four cores is slower than a sequential version running on a single machine? Let\u2019s analyze the problem.</p> <p>If we have a slice of, say, 1,024 elements, the parent goroutine will spin up two goroutines, each in charge of handling a half consisting of 512 elements. Each of these goroutines will spin up two new goroutines in charge of handling 256 elements, then 128, and so on, until we spin up a goroutine to compute a single element.</p> <p>If the workload that we want to parallelize is too small, meaning we\u2019re going to compute it too fast, the benefit of distributing a job across cores is destroyed: the time it takes to create a goroutine and have the scheduler execute it is much too high compared to directly merging a tiny number of items in the current goroutine. Although goroutines are lightweight and faster to start than threads, we can still face cases where a workload is too small.</p> <p>So what can we conclude from this result? Does it mean the merge sort algorithm cannot be parallelized? Wait, not so fast.</p> <p>Let\u2019s try another approach. Because merging a tiny number of elements within a new goroutine isn\u2019t efficient, let\u2019s define a threshold. This threshold will represent how many elements a half should contain in order to be handled in a parallel manner. If the number of elements in the half is fewer than this value, we will handle it sequentially. Here\u2019s a new version:</p> <pre><code>const max = 2048 // Defines the threshold\n\nfunc parallelMergesortV2(s []int) {\n    if len(s) &lt;= 1 {\n        return\n    }\n\n    if len(s) &lt;= max {\n        sequentialMergesort(s) // Calls our initial sequential version\n    } else { // If bigger than the threshold, keeps the parallel version\n        middle := len(s) / 2\n\n        var wg sync.WaitGroup\n        wg.Add(2)\n\n        go func() {\n            defer wg.Done()\n            parallelMergesortV2(s[:middle])\n        }()\n\n        go func() {\n            defer wg.Done()\n            parallelMergesortV2(s[middle:])\n        }()\n\n        wg.Wait()\n        merge(s, middle)\n    }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>If the number of elements in the s slice is smaller than max, we call the sequential version. Otherwise, we keep calling our parallel implementation. Does this approach impact the result? Yes, it does:</p> <pre><code>Benchmark_sequentialMergesort-4       2278993555 ns/op\nBenchmark_parallelMergesortV1-4      17525998709 ns/op\nBenchmark_parallelMergesortV2-4       1313010260 ns/op\n</code></pre> <p>Our v2 parallel implementation is more than 40% faster than the sequential one, thanks to this idea of defining a threshold to indicate when parallel should be more efficient than sequential.</p> Note <p>Why did I set the threshold to 2,048? Because it was the optimal value for this specific workload on my machine. In general, such magic values should be defined carefully with benchmarks (running on an execution environment similar to production). It\u2019s also pretty interesting to note that running the same algorithm in a programming language that doesn\u2019t implement the concept of goroutines has an impact on the value. For example, running the same example in Java using threads means an optimal value closer to 8,192.

However, external processes may run in the background, which may affect benchmark results. For that reason, tools such as <code>perflock</code> can limit how much CPU a benchmark can consume. For example, we can run a benchmark with 70% of the total available CPU, giving 30% to the OS and other processes and reducing the impact of the machine activity factor on the results.</p> <p>One option is to increase the benchmark time using the <code>-benchtime</code> option.

The problem is that the developer wasn\u2019t careful enough about compiler optimizations. In this case, the function under test is simple enough to be a candidate for inlining: an optimization that replaces a function call with the body of the called function and lets us prevent a function call, which has a small footprint. Once the function is inlined, the compiler notices that the call has no side effects and replaces it with the following benchmark:</p> <pre><code>func BenchmarkPopcnt1(b *testing.B) {\n    for i := 0; i &lt; b.N; i++ {\n        // Empty\n    }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>The benchmark is now empty \u2014 which is why we got a result close to one clock cycle.

Then we assign the latest result to the global variable.</p> Note <p>Why not assign the result of the popcnt call directly to global to simplify the test? Writing to a global variable is slower than writing to a local variable (these concepts are discussed in 100 Go Mistakes, mistake #95: \u201cNot understanding stack vs. heap\u201d).

Again, because we iterate only over the first eight columns, this result is quite surprising.</p> <p>To understand this difference, we need to understand the basics of CPU caches. In a nutshell, a CPU is composed of different caches (usually L1, L2, and L3). These caches reduce the average cost of accessing data from the main memory. In some conditions, the CPU can fetch data from the main memory and copy it to L1. In this case, the CPU tries to fetch into L1 the matrix\u2019s subset that <code>calculateSum</code> is interested in (the first eight columns of each row). However, the matrix fits in memory in one case (513 columns) but not in the other case (512 columns).</p> Note <p>This isn\u2019t in the scope of this post to explain why, but we look at this problem in 100 Go Mistakes, mistake #91: \u201cNot understanding CPU caches.\u201d</p> <p>Coming back to the benchmark, the main issue is that we keep reusing the same matrix in both cases. Because the function is repeated thousands of times, we don\u2019t measure the function\u2019s execution when it receives a plain new matrix. Instead, we measure a function that gets a matrix that already has a subset of the cells present in the cache. Therefore, because <code>calculateSum513</code> leads to fewer cache misses, it has a better execution time.</p> <p>This is an example of the observer effect. Because we keep observing a repeatedly called CPU-bound function, CPU caching may come into play and significantly affect the results. In this example, to prevent this effect, we should create a matrix during each test instead of reusing one:</p> <pre><code>func BenchmarkCalculateSum512(b *testing.B) {\n    var sum int64\n    for i := 0; i &lt; b.N; i++ {\n        b.StopTimer()\n        s := createMatrix512(rows) // Create a new matrix during each loop iteration\n        b.StartTimer()\n        sum = calculateSum512(s)\n    }\n    res = sum\n}\n</code></pre> <p>A new matrix is now created during each loop iteration. If we run the benchmark again (and adjust <code>benchtime</code> \u2014 otherwise, it takes too long to execute), the results are closer to each other:</p> <pre><code>cpu: Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-7360U CPU @ 2.30GHz\nBenchmarkCalculateSum512-4         1116             33547 ns/op\nBenchmarkCalculateSum513-4          998             35507 ns/op\n</code></pre> <p>Instead of making the incorrect assumption that calculateSum513 is faster, we see that both benchmarks lead to similar results when receiving a new matrix.</p> <p>As we have seen in this post, because we were reusing the same matrix, CPU caches significantly impacted the results. To prevent this, we had to create a new matrix during each loop iteration. In general, we should remember that observing a function under test may lead to significant differences in results, especially in the context of micro-benchmarks of CPU-bound functions where low-level optimizations matter. Forcing a benchmark to re-create data during each iteration can be a good way to prevent this effect.</p>"},{"location":"9-generics/","title":"Being confused about when to use generics","text":"<p>Generics is a fresh addition to the language.

Before generics, Go developers had a couple of options: using code generation, reflection, or duplicating code.</p> <p>For example, we could write two functions, one for each map type, or even try to extend <code>getKeys</code> to accept different map types:</p> <pre><code>func getKeys(m any) ([]any, error) {\n    switch t := m.(type) {\n    default:\n        return nil, fmt.Errorf(\"unknown type: %T\", t)\n    case map[string]int:\n        var keys []any\n        for k := range t {\n            keys = append(keys, k)\n        }\n        return keys, nil\n    case map[int]string:\n        // Copy the extraction logic\n    }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>We can start noticing a couple of issues:</p> <ul> <li>First, it increases boilerplate code. Indeed, whenever we want to add a case, it will require duplicating the <code>range</code> loop.</li> <li>Meanwhile, the function now accepts an empty interface, which means we are losing some of the benefits of Go being a typed language. Indeed, checking whether a type is supported is done at runtime instead of compile-time. Hence, we also need to return an error if the provided type is unknown.</li> <li>Last but not least, as the key type can be either <code>int</code> or <code>string</code>, we are obliged to return a slice of empty interfaces to factor out key types. This approach increases the effort on the caller-side as the client may also have to perform a type check of the keys or extra conversion.</li> </ul> <p>Thanks to generics, we can now refactor this code using type parameters.</p> <p>Type parameters are generic types we can use with functions and types. For example, the following function accepts a type parameter:</p> <pre><code>func foo[T any](t T) {\n    // ...\n}\n</code></pre> <p>When calling <code>foo</code>, we will pass a type argument of any type. Passing a type argument is called instantiation because the work is done at compile time which keeps type safety as part of the core language features and avoids runtime overheads.</p> <p>Let\u2019s get back to the <code>getKeys</code> function and use type parameters to write a generic version that would accept any kind of map:</p> <pre><code>func getKeys[K comparable, V any](m map[K]V) []K {\n  var keys []K\n  for k := range m {\n    keys = append(keys, k)\n  }\n  return keys\n}\n</code></pre> <p>To handle the map, we defined two kinds of type parameters. First, the values can be of any type: <code>V any</code>. However, in Go, the map keys can\u2019t be of any type. For example, we cannot use slices:</p> <pre><code>var m map[[]byte]int\n</code></pre> <p>This code leads to a compilation error: <code>invalid map key type []byte</code>. Therefore, instead of accepting any key type, we are obliged to restrict type arguments so that the key type meets specific requirements. Here, being comparable (we can use <code>==</code> or <code>!=</code>). Hence, we defined <code>K</code> as <code>comparable</code> instead of <code>any</code>.</p> <p>Restricting type arguments to match specific requirements is called a constraint. A constraint is an interface type that can contain:</p> <ul> <li>A set of behaviors (methods)</li> <li>But also arbitrary type</li> </ul> <p>Let\u2019s see a concrete example for the latter. Imagine we don\u2019t want to accept any <code>comparable</code> type for map key type. For instance, we would like to restrict it to either <code>int</code> or <code>string</code> types.

Then, <code>K</code> is now a <code>customConstraint</code> instead of a <code>comparable</code> as before.</p> <p>Now, the signature of <code>getKeys</code> enforces that we can call it with a map of any value type, but the key type has to be an <code>int</code> or a <code>string</code>. For example, on the caller-side:</p> <pre><code>m = map[string]int{\n   \"one\":   1,\n   \"two\":   2,\n   \"three\": 3,\n}\nkeys := getKeys(m)\n</code></pre> <p>Note that Go can infer that <code>getKeys</code> is called with a <code>string</code> type argument. The previous call was similar to this:</p> <pre><code>keys := getKeys[string](m)\n</code></pre> Note <p>What\u2019s the difference between a constraint using <code>~int</code> or <code>int</code>? Using <code>int</code> restricts it to that type, whereas <code>~int</code> restricts all the types whose underlying type is an <code>int</code>.</p> <p>To illustrate it, let\u2019s imagine a constraint where we would like to restrict a type to any <code>int</code> type implementing the <code>String() string</code> method:</p> <pre><code>type customConstraint interface {\n   ~int\n   String() string\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Using this constraint will restrict type arguments to custom types like this one:</p> <pre><code>type customInt int\n\nfunc (i customInt) String() string {\n   return strconv.Itoa(int(i))\n}\n</code></pre> <p>As <code>customInt</code> is an <code>int</code> and implements the <code>String() string</code> method, the <code>customInt</code> type satisfies the constraint defined.</p> <p>However, if we change the constraint to contain an <code>int</code> instead of an <code>~int</code>, using <code>customInt</code> would lead to a compilation error because the <code>int</code> type doesn\u2019t implement <code>String() string</code>.</p> <p>Let\u2019s also note the <code>constraints</code> package contains a set of common constraints such as <code>Signed</code> that includes all the signed integer types. Let\u2019s ensure that a constraint doesn\u2019t already exist in this package before creating a new one.</p> <p>So far, we have discussed examples using generics for functions. However, we can also use generics with data structures.</p> <p>For example, we will create a linked list containing values of any type. Meanwhile, we will write an <code>Add</code> method to append a node:</p> <pre><code>type Node[T any] struct { // Use type parameter\n   Val  T\n   next *Node[T]\n}\n\nfunc (n *Node[T]) Add(next *Node[T]) { // Instantiate type receiver\n   n.next = next\n}\n</code></pre> <p>We use type parameters to define <code>T</code> and use both fields in <code>Node</code>. Regarding the method, the receiver is instantiated. Indeed, because <code>Node</code> is generic, it has to follow also the type parameter defined.</p> <p>One last thing to note about type parameters: they can\u2019t be used on methods, only on functions. For example, the following method wouldn\u2019t compile:</p> <pre><code>type Foo struct {}\n\nfunc (Foo) bar[T any](t T) {}\n</code></pre> <pre><code>./main.go:29:15: methods cannot have type parameters\n</code></pre> <p>Now, let\u2019s delve into concrete cases where we should and shouldn\u2019t use generics.</p>"},{"location":"9-generics/#common-uses-and-misuses","title":"Common uses and misuses","text":"<p>So when are generics useful? Let\u2019s discuss a couple of common uses where generics are recommended:</p> <ul> <li>Data structures. For example, we can use generics to factor out the element type if we implement a binary tree, a linked list, or a heap.</li> <li>Functions working with slices, maps, and channels of any type. For example, a function to merge two channels would work with any channel type. Hence, we could use type parameters to factor out the channel type:</li> </ul> <pre><code>func merge[T any](ch1, ch2 &lt;-chan T) &lt;-chan T {\n    // ...\n}\n</code></pre> <ul> <li>Meanwhile, instead of factoring out a type, we can factor out behaviors. For example, the <code>sort</code> package contains functions to sort different slice types such as <code>sort.Ints</code> or <code>sort.Float64s</code>. Using type parameters, we can factor out the sorting behaviors that rely on three methods, <code>Len</code>, <code>Less</code>, and <code>Swap</code>:</li> </ul> <pre><code>type sliceFn[T any] struct { // Use type parameter\n   s       []T\n   compare func(T, T) bool // Compare two T elements\n}\n\nfunc (s sliceFn[T]) Len() int           { return len(s.s) }\nfunc (s sliceFn[T]) Less(i, j int) bool { return s.compare(s.s[i], s.s[j]) }\nfunc (s sliceFn[T]) Swap(i, j int)      { s.s[i], s.s[j] = s.s[j], s.s[i] }\n</code></pre> <p>Conversely, when is it recommended not to use generics?</p> <ul> <li>When just calling a method of the type argument.

We have seen that some specific caches (typically, L1 and L2) aren\u2019t shared among all the logical cores but are specific to a physical core. This specificity has some concrete impacts such as concurrency and the concept of false sharing, which can lead to a significant performance decrease. Let\u2019s look at what false sharing is via an example and then see how to prevent it.</p> <p>In this example, we use two structs, <code>Input</code> and <code>Result</code>:</p> <pre><code>type Input struct {\n    a int64\n    b int64\n}\n\ntype Result struct {\n    sumA int64\n    sumB int64\n}\n</code></pre> <p>The goal is to implement a <code>count</code> function that receives a slice of <code>Input</code> and computes the following:</p> <ul> <li>The sum of all the <code>Input.a</code> fields into <code>Result.sumA</code></li> <li>The sum of all the <code>Input.b</code> fields into <code>Result.sumB</code></li> </ul> <p>For the sake of the example, we implement a concurrent solution with one goroutine that computes <code>sumA</code> and another that computes <code>sumB</code>:</p> <pre><code>func count(inputs []Input) Result {\n    wg := sync.WaitGroup{}\n    wg.Add(2)\n\n    result := Result{} // Init the result struct\n\n    go func() {\n        for i := 0; i &lt; len(inputs); i++ {\n            result.sumA += inputs[i].a // Computes sumA\n        }\n        wg.Done()\n    }()\n\n    go func() {\n        for i := 0; i &lt; len(inputs); i++ {\n            result.sumB += inputs[i].b // Computes sumB\n        }\n        wg.Done()\n    }()\n\n    wg.Wait()\n    return result\n}\n</code></pre> <p>We spin up two goroutines: one that iterates over each a field and another that iterates over each b field. This example is fine from a concurrency perspective. For instance, it doesn\u2019t lead to a data race, because each goroutine increments its own variable. But this example illustrates the false sharing concept that degrades expected performance.</p> <p>Let\u2019s look at the main memory. Because <code>sumA</code> and <code>sumB</code> are allocated contiguously, in most cases (seven out of eight), both variables are allocated to the same memory block:</p> <p> </p> In this example, sumA and sumB are part of the same memory block. <p>Now, let\u2019s assume that the machine contains two cores. In most cases, we should eventually have two threads scheduled on different cores. So if the CPU decides to copy this memory block to a cache line, it is copied twice:</p> <p> </p> Each block is copied to a cache line on both code 0 and core 1. <p>Both cache lines are replicated because L1D (L1 data) is per core. Recall that in our example, each goroutine updates its own variable: <code>sumA</code> on one side, and <code>sumB</code> on the other side:</p> <p> </p> Each goroutine updates its own variable. <p>Because these cache lines are replicated, one of the goals of the CPU is to guarantee cache coherency. For example, if one goroutine updates <code>sumA</code> and another reads <code>sumA</code> (after some synchronization), we expect our application to get the latest value.</p> <p>However, our example doesn\u2019t do exactly this. Both goroutines access their own variables, not a shared one. We might expect the CPU to know about this and understand that it isn\u2019t a conflict, but this isn\u2019t the case. When we write a variable that\u2019s in a cache, the granularity tracked by the CPU isn\u2019t the variable: it\u2019s the cache line.</p> <p>When a cache line is shared across multiple cores and at least one goroutine is a writer, the entire cache line is invalidated. This happens even if the updates are logically independent (for example, <code>sumA</code> and <code>sumB</code>). This is the problem of false sharing, and it degrades performance.</p> Note <p>Internally, a CPU uses the MESI protocol to guarantee cache coherency. It tracks each cache line, marking it modified, exclusive, shared, or invalid (MESI).</p> <p>One of the most important aspects to understand about memory and caching is that sharing memory across cores isn\u2019t real\u2014it\u2019s an illusion. This understanding comes from the fact that we don\u2019t consider a machine a black box; instead, we try to have mechanical sympathy with underlying levels.</p> <p>So how do we solve false sharing? There are two main solutions.</p> <p>The first solution is to use the same approach we\u2019ve shown but ensure that <code>sumA</code> and <code>sumB</code> aren\u2019t part of the same cache line. For example, we can update the <code>Result</code> struct to add padding between the fields. Padding is a technique to allocate extra memory. Because an <code>int64</code> requires an 8-byte allocation and a cache line 64 bytes long, we need 64 \u2013 8 = 56 bytes of padding:</p> <pre><code>type Result struct {\n    sumA int64\n    _    [56]byte // Padding\n    sumB int64\n}\n</code></pre> <p>The next figure shows a possible memory allocation. Using padding, <code>sumA</code> and <code>sumB</code> will always be part of different memory blocks and hence different cache lines.</p> <p> </p> sumA and sumB are part of different memory blocks. <p>If we benchmark both solutions (with and without padding), we see that the padding solution is significantly faster (about 40% on my machine). This is an important improvement that results from the addition of padding between the two fields to prevent false sharing.</p> <p>The second solution is to rework the structure of the algorithm. For example, instead of having both goroutines share the same struct, we can make them communicate their local result via channels. The result benchmark is roughly the same as with padding.</p> <p>In summary, we must remember that sharing memory across goroutines is an illusion at the lowest memory levels. False sharing occurs when a cache line is shared across two cores when at least one goroutine is a writer. If we need to optimize an application that relies on concurrency, we should check whether false sharing applies, because this pattern is known to degrade application performance. We can prevent false sharing with either padding or communication.</p>"},{"location":"98-profiling-execution-tracing/","title":"Not using Go diagnostics tooling","text":"<p>Go offers a few excellent diagnostics tools to help us get insights into how an application performs.

When it is activated, the application asks the OS to interrupt it every 10 ms by default via a <code>SIGPROF</code> signal. When the application receives a <code>SIGPROF</code>, it suspends the current activity and transfers the execution to the profiler. The profiler collects data such as the current goroutine activity and aggregates execution statistics that we can retrieve. Then it stops, and the execution resumes until the next <code>SIGPROF</code>.</p> <p>We can access the /debug/pprof/profile endpoint to activate CPU profiling. Accessing this endpoint executes CPU profiling for 30 seconds by default. For 30 seconds, our application is interrupted every 10 ms. Note that we can change these two default values: we can use the <code>seconds</code> parameter to pass to the endpoint how long the profiling should last (for example, /debug/pprof/profile?seconds=15), and we can change the interruption rate (even to less than 10 ms). But in most cases, 10 ms should be enough, and in decreasing this value (meaning increasing the rate), we should be careful not to harm performance. After 30 seconds, we download the results of the CPU profiler.</p> Note <p>We can also enable the CPU profiler using the <code>-cpuprofile</code> flag, such as when running a benchmark. For example, the following command produces the same type of file that can be downloaded via /debug/ pprof/profile.</p> <pre><code>$ go test -bench=. -cpuprofile profile.out\n</code></pre> <p>From this file, we can navigate to the results using <code>go tool</code>:</p> <pre><code>$ go tool pprof -http=:8080 &lt;file&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>This command opens a web UI showing the call graph. The next figure shows an example taken from an application. The larger the arrow, the more it was a hot path. We can then navigate into this graph and get execution insights.</p> <p> </p> Figure 1: The call graph of an application during 30 seconds. <p>For example, the graph in the next figure tells us that during 30 seconds, 0.06 seconds were spent in the <code>decode</code> method (<code>*FetchResponse</code> receiver). Of these 0.06 seconds, 0.02 were spent in <code>RecordBatch.decode</code> and 0.01 in <code>makemap</code> (creating a map).</p> <p> </p> Figure 2: Example call graph. <p>We can also access this kind of information from the web UI with different representations. For example, the Top view sorts the functions per execution time, and Flame Graph visualizes the execution time hierarchy. The UI can even display the expensive parts of the source code line by line.</p> Note <p>We can also delve into profiling data via a command line. However, we focus on the web UI in this post.</p> <p>Thanks to this data, we can get a general idea of how an application behaves:</p> <ul> <li>Too many calls to <code>runtime.mallogc</code> can mean an excessive number of small heap allocations that we can try to minimize.</li> <li>Too much time spent in channel operations or mutex locks can indicate excessive contention that is harming the application\u2019s performance.</li> <li>Too much time spent on <code>syscall.Read</code> or <code>syscall.Write</code> means the application spends a significant amount of time in Kernel mode. Working on I/O buffering may be an avenue for improvement.</li> </ul> <p>These are the kinds of insights we can get from the CPU profiler. It\u2019s valuable to understand the hottest code path and identify bottlenecks. But it won\u2019t determine more than the configured rate because the CPU profiler is executed at a fixed pace (by default, 10 ms). To get finer-grained insights, we should use tracing, which we discuss later in this post.</p> Note <p>We can also attach labels to the different functions.

For example, the amount of heap memory held by the newTopicProducer method (top left) has decreased (\u2013513 KB). In contrast, the amount held by updateMetadata (bottom right) has increased (+512 KB). Slow increases are normal. The second heap profile may have been calculated in the middle of a service call, for example.

In User-Defined Tasks, we can follow the duration distribution:</p> <p> </p> Figure 10: Distribution of user-level tasks. <p>We see that in most cases, the <code>fibonacci</code> task is executed in less than 15 microseconds, whereas the <code>store</code> task takes less than 6309 nanoseconds.</p> <p>In the previous section, we discussed the kinds of information we can get from CPU profiling. What are the main differences compared to the data we can get from user-level traces?</p> <ul> <li>CPU profiling:<ul> <li>Sample-based</li> <li>Per function</li> <li>Doesn\u2019t go below the sampling rate (10 ms by default)</li> </ul> </li> <li>User-level traces:<ul> <li>Not sample-based</li> <li>Per-goroutine execution (unless we use the <code>runtime/trace</code> package)</li> <li>Time executions aren\u2019t bound by any rate</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>In summary, the execution tracer is a powerful tool for understanding how an application performs. As we have seen with the merge sort example, we can identify poorly parallelized execution. However, the tracer\u2019s granularity remains per goroutine unless we manually use <code>runtime/trace</code> compared to a CPU profile, for example. We can use both profiling and the execution tracer to get the most out of the standard Go diagnostics tools when optimizing an application.</p>"},{"location":"book/","title":"100 Go Mistakes and How to Avoid Them","text":""},{"location":"book/#description","title":"Description","text":"<p>If you're a Go developer looking to improve your skills, the 100 Go Mistakes and How to Avoid Them book is for you.

Finally, we\u2019ll introduce the concepts this book covers.</p>"},{"location":"chapter-1/#go-outline","title":"Go outline","text":"<p>If you are reading this book, it\u2019s likely that you\u2019re already sold on Go. Therefore, this section provides a brief reminder about what makes Go such a powerful language.</p> <p>Software engineering has evolved considerably during the past decades. Most modern systems are no longer written by a single person but by teams consisting of multiple programmers\u2014sometimes even hundreds, if not thousands. Nowadays, code must be readable, expressive, and maintainable to guarantee a system\u2019s durability over the years. Meanwhile, in our fast-moving world, maximizing agility and reducing the time to market is critical for most organizations. Programming should also follow this trend, and companies strive to ensure that software engineers are as productive as possible when reading, writing, and maintaining code.</p> <p>In response to these challenges, Google created the Go programming language in 2007. Since then, many organizations have adopted the language to support various use cases: APIs, automation, databases, CLIs (command-line interfaces), and so on. Many today consider Go the language of the cloud.</p> <p>Feature-wise, Go has no type inheritance, no exceptions, no macros, no partial functions, no support for lazy variable evaluation or immutability, no operator overloading, no pattern matching, and on and on. Why are these features missing from the language? The official Go FAQ gives us some insight:</p> <p>Go FAQ</p> <p>Why does Go not have feature X? Your favorite feature may be missing because it doesn\u2019t fit, because it affects compilation speed or clarity of design, or because it would make the fundamental system model too difficult.</p> <p>Judging the quality of a programming language via its number of features is probably not an accurate metric. At least, it\u2019s not an objective of Go. Instead, Go utilizes a few essential characteristics when adopting a language at scale for an organization. These include the following:</p> <ul> <li>Stability\u2014Even though Go receives frequent updates (including improvements and security patches), it remains a stable language. Some may even consider this one of the best features of the language.</li> <li>Expressivity\u2014We can define expressivity in a programming language by how naturally and intuitively we can write and read code. A reduced number of keywords and limited ways to solve common problems make Go an expressive language for large codebases.</li> <li>Compilation\u2014As developers, what can be more exasperating than having to wait for a build to test our application? Targeting fast compilation times has always been a conscious goal for the language designers. This, in turn, enables productivity.</li> <li>Safety\u2014Go is a strong, statically typed language. Hence, it has strict compiletime rules, which ensure the code is type-safe in most cases.</li> </ul> <p>Go was built from the ground up with solid features such as outstanding concurrency primitives with goroutines and channels. There\u2019s not a strong need to rely on external libraries to build efficient concurrent applications. Observing how important concurrency is these days also demonstrates why Go is such a suitable language for the present and probably for the foreseeable future.</p> <p>Some also consider Go a simple language. And, in a sense, this isn\u2019t necessarily wrong. For example, a newcomer can learn the language\u2019s main features in less than a day. So why read a book centered on the concept of mistakes if Go is simple?</p>"},{"location":"chapter-1/#simple-doesnt-mean-easy","title":"Simple doesn\u2019t mean easy","text":"<p>There is a subtle difference between simple and easy. Simple, applied to a technology, means not complicated to learn or understand. However, easy means that we can achieve anything without much effort. Go is simple to learn but not necessarily easy to master.</p> <p>Let\u2019s take concurrency, for example. In 2019, a study focusing on concurrency bugs was published: Understanding Real-World Concurrency Bugs in Go. This study was the first systematic analysis of concurrency bugs. It focused on multiple popular Go repositories such as Docker, gRPC, and Kubernetes. One of the most important takeaways from this study is that most of the blocking bugs are caused by inaccurate use of the message-passing paradigm via channels, despite the belief that message passing is easier to handle and less error-prone than sharing memory.</p> <p>What should be an appropriate reaction to such a takeaway? Should we consider that the language designers were wrong about message passing? Should we reconsider how we deal with concurrency in our project? Of course not.</p> <p>It\u2019s not a question of confronting message passing versus sharing memory and determining the winner. However, it\u2019s up to us as Go developers to thoroughly understand how to use concurrency, its implications on modern processors, when to favor one approach over the other, and how to avoid common traps. This example highlights that although a concept such as channels and goroutines can be simple to learn, it isn\u2019t an easy topic in practice.</p> <p>This leitmotif\u2014simple doesn\u2019t mean easy\u2014can be generalized to many aspects of Go, not only concurrency. Hence, to be proficient Go developers, we must have a thorough understanding of many aspects of the language, which requires time, effort, and mistakes.</p> <p>This book aims to help accelerate our journey toward proficiency by delving into 100 Go mistakes.</p>"},{"location":"chapter-1/#100-go-mistakes","title":"100 Go mistakes","text":"<p>Why should we read a book about common Go mistakes? Why not deepen our knowledge with an ordinary book that would dig into different topics?</p> <p>In a 2011 article, neuroscientists proved that the best time for brain growth is when we\u2019re facing mistakes. <sup>1</sup> Haven\u2019t we all experienced the process of learning from a mistake and recalling that occasion after months or even years, when some context related to it? As presented in another article, by Janet Metcalfe, this happens because mistakes have a facilitative effect. <sup>2</sup> The main idea is that we can remember not only the error but also the context surrounding the mistake. This is one of the reasons why learning from mistakes is so efficient.</p> <p>To strengthen this facilitative effect, this book accompanies each mistake as much as possible with real-world examples.

In 2020, a study conducted by Synopsys estimated the cost of software bugs in the U.S. alone to be over $2 trillion. <sup>3</sup></p> <p>Furthermore, bugs can also lead to tragic impacts. We can, for example, mention cases such as Therac-25, a radiation therapy machine produced by Atomic Energy of Canada Limited (AECL). Because of a race condition, the machine gave its patients radiation doses that were hundreds of times greater than expected, leading to the death of three patients. Hence, software bugs aren\u2019t only about money. As developers, we should remember how impactful our jobs are.</p> <p>This book covers plenty of cases that could lead to various software bugs, including data races, leaks, logic errors, and other defects. Although accurate tests should be a way to discover such bugs as early as possible, we may sometimes miss cases because of different factors such as time constraints or complexity.

A significant part of software complexity comes from the fact that, as developers, we strive to think about imaginary futures.

However, this leads to more drawbacks than benefits in most cases because it can make a codebase more complex to understand and reason about.</p> <p>Getting back to Go, we can think of plenty of use cases where developers might be tempted to design abstractions for future needs, such as interfaces or generics.

However, today\u2019s software engineering is programming with a time dimension: making sure we can still work with and maintain an application months, years, or perhaps even decades later.</p> <p>When programming in Go, we can make many mistakes that can harm readability.
